Analysis Report on Security vulnerabilities from 2 research papers.

Research work on how the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm is less secure than expected. The attack was based on efficiently compromising exponents by computing discrete log of public value. A large precomputation for a prime number helped in doing so. Statistics show how 82% of vulnerable servers used 512-bit group for export grade cryptography.
